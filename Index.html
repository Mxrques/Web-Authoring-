            <p> Doodle.io is a website designed to allow the user to draw on the templates which we provide!
                Another thing we allow you to do is to have the freedom to draw whatever you like as we provide ranges of colours, tools and shapes!
                From there onwards we allow you to submit your creation to us to be featured on our website, and also give you the ability to download save or upload your creation.</p>

            <h3> Yours Could Be Next!</h3>
            
            <p> To get featured here or on our website all you have to do is scroll down and go the draw section. and create your master piece! And then from there you can upload your work from there once you are ready and finished creating your design.</p>
